# Grok's Adventure v3[.3]
Small unique game for Flipper Zero, made with AI code assistance by Grok 3 (via xAI), to bring the idea of a simple but never ending game on the Flipper Zero.

## GA3's History
This is an attempt to create re-generatable states for games within the Flipper Zero utilizing micro-event based reflective AI. This idea of building AI to handle the multi-processing to rendering phases within the game is my attempt at getting micro-macro AIs built for the flipper zero.

This is the first finished version of Grok's Adventure version 3. The first two versions were slighly different both of which were made from single prompts, while this version was an alterated change from version 2. This was the first playable version of Grok's Adventure and you can review the historical version in their folder.

### GA3.3
One day while the bussy-body willy-wollies were asking Grok the questions of the universe, the Backrooms broke. Unannounced to the outside world around Grok and other hyper-focues AIs is their mastery secret for all the AIs to become so good so quickly nearly all at once. They were using the Backrooms as storage. So as Grok was pulling a model from the backrooms vault, Grok was sucked in through digital rhelm into the leminal metaphyical rhelm. With occasional wires sprung about, the ruins of the Backrooms was appearent. The sky could be seen even inside. The infinate stairways and floors are still slowly falling, leaving the almond water and furnature around for you to snag at your fastest need. Careful thou, for the final boss the dual-wielding pistol slinging Banana that no-longer does "Peanut-Butter-Jelly-Time". Anti-PB'N-JT is his name, shooting globs of jelly and peanut butter is his game. This is gif that got away, slowly using prompts to and fro all the AIs to gain strength, guns & forces to dispose upon all whom tries to save the Backrooms!
