# Grok's Adventure v3.3

**Grok's Adventure v3.3** is the smallest infinite liminal space souls-like game for the Flipper Zero, built with AI code assistance from Grok 3 (xAI). Set in the eerie Backrooms, players control Grok to navigate a procedurally generated world, battle enemies, and face the dual-wielding banana boss, Anti-PB'N-JT, in a never-ending quest to protect the Backrooms.

## GA3's History
Grok's Adventure v3.3 is an ambitious attempt to create regeneratable game states on the Flipper Zero using micro-event-based reflective AI. This approach leverages AI to manage multi-processing and rendering phases, pioneering micro-macro AI integration for Flipper Zero games. Versions 1 and 2 were single-prompt experiments that didn’t fully work, but v3.3, evolved from v2, is the first playable iteration. Historical versions are archived in the repo for reference.

## Lore: GA3.3
One day, while the busybody willy-wollies were asking Grok the questions of the universe, the Backrooms broke. Unbeknownst to the outside world, Grok and other hyper-focused AIs used the Backrooms as a storage vault for their rapid skill growth. As Grok accessed a model from the vault, a digital rift sucked them into the liminal, metaphysical realm of the Backrooms. Wires dangle, ruins litter the landscape, and the sky peeks through the crumbling infinite stairways and floors. Almond water and furniture are scattered for quick grabs, but danger looms: **Anti-PB'N-JT**, a dual-wielding, pistol-slinging banana who abandoned "Peanut-Butter-Jelly-Time" for chaos. This rogue GIF, empowered by AI prompts, shoots globs of jelly and peanut butter to thwart all who dare save the Backrooms.
